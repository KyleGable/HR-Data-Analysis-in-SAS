This project was conducted as part of a thesis project for my (Kyle Gable's) graduation from the Honors College at Oakland University.

Conclusions in this paper reflect my thoughts and conclusions only, not the thoughts and conclusions of the University.
The conclusions made as a result of this project should be only be considered with great thought.
As a disclaimer, a significant amount of those sampled as part of this dataset worked in the HR industry, so use caution when generalizing.

This dataset was originally made available by Edward Babushkin, who made it available on his blog here:https://edwvb.blogspot.com/2017/10/employee-turnover-how-to-predict-individual-risks-of-quitting.html
I found this dataset from a Kaggle page made by Davin Wijaya here:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davinwijaya/employee-turnover
I translated this dataset further than what was provided by Davin, if there are any translation errors, let me know.
